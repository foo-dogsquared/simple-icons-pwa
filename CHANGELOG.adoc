=== Added 

* Add a status bar for the selection.

=== Changed 

* Update the look of the site. 




== [2.0.1] - 2019-10-19 


=== Changed 

* Update the site assets. 




== [2.0.0] - 2019-10-18 


=== Changed

* Remake made possible with https://vuejs.org/[Vue]. 
Though, it is more in a testing phase to see what possible implementations can be done. 
* Change the site to being a statically generated content instead of being server-sided. 
(It is a bit of an overkill, in my opinion.) 


=== Removed 

* As an effect of the remake being static, the API has been completely removed.
