The website uses the official icon set from the https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/[GitHub repo]. 




== Features

* Quickly create a SVG symbol sheet from the Simple Icons icon set. 
* It works as a progressive web app (PWA) and can work in offline mode. 
* Download the icons through an https://css-tricks.com/svg-symbol-good-choice-icons/[SVG symbol spritesheet] or individual files inside of a ZIP file.

=== Technology overview 

* The project is scaffolded from https://cli.vuejs.org[**Vue CLI service**]. 
* It uses https://vuejs.org/[**Vue.js**] for the front-end web components library. 
* It uses https://webpack.js.org/[**Webpack**] for bundling the app for offline use. 
* It uses https://babeljs.io/[**Babel**] for transpiling JS code into older versions for compatability. 
* Uses the official https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/[**Simple Icons library**]. 
* Creates the zip files with https://github.com/Stuk/jszip[**JSZip**]. 
* Client-side file generation is made possible with https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js[**FileSaver.js**].
